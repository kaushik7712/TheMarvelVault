            <b> Marvel Comics </b> was founded in 1939 as Timely Publications
            and later became known as Marvel in the 1960s. In the early years,
            they produced superhero titles like Captain America, Human Torch,
            and Sub-Mariner. However, it was in the 1960s that Marvel
            revolutionized the comic book industry by introducing iconic
            characters such as Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four, the X-Men, Iron
            Man, Thor, Hulk, and many others, under the guidance of legendary
            creators like Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, and others.
            Marvel's approach differed by featuring flawed, relatable heroes
            dealing with everyday life struggles alongside their superhero
            responsibilities. This approach connected with readers and set
            Marvel apart in the industry. The interconnected universe of
            characters was another key feature, as heroes often crossed paths
            and shared the same world.
            <br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Over the decades, Marvel expanded its
            universe, exploring complex storylines, creating crossover events,
            and captivating audiences through various mediums like cartoons,
            movies, TV shows, and merchandise.
            <b>The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) </b>further catapulted
            Marvel's popularity, making its characters and stories globally
            recognized and beloved. In the 1980s and 1990s, Marvel faced
            financial difficulties but managed to rebound by exploring new
            storylines and characters. Titles like "The Uncanny X-Men," "The
            Amazing Spider-Man," and "The Avengers" continued to captivate
            audiences. <br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; During the 2000s, Marvel Comics
            experienced a resurgence in popularity with major crossover events
            such as "Civil War," "House of M," and "Secret Invasion." The
            company also underwent changes in ownership and expanded its reach
            by delving into film adaptations, starting with the release of
            "X-Men" in 2000, followed by "Spider-Man," and later establishing
            its own Marvel Cinematic Universe with "Iron Man" in 2008. The
            success of the MCU films, each interconnected with a shared universe
            and culminating in massive team-up movies like "The Avengers,"
            brought Marvel characters to an even broader audience, turning them
            into global pop culture icons. Beyond movies, Marvel's storytelling
            expanded into various media, including animated series, video games,
            merchandise, and digital platforms. They continued to introduce
            diverse characters and storylines, reflecting societal changes and
            addressing relevant issues. Marvel's rich history and commitment to
            storytelling have solidified its position as a powerhouse in the
            entertainment industry, continually engaging audiences with
            compelling narratives and iconic superheroes.
